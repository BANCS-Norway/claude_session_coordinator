## Overview

Claude Session Coordinator provides a storage adapter-based MCP server that enables multiple Claude sessions to:
- Share state and coordinate work
- Avoid conflicts when working in parallel
- Track progress across sessions
- Support multiple workflow patterns

**Core Philosophy:** Flexible primitives over opinionated workflows. The server provides simple, universal building blocks that support any coordination pattern.

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo containing:

- **`packages/mcp-server/`** - Python MCP server with storage adapters
- **`packages/homepage/`** - Public documentation site (for Phase 2+ launch)
- **`docs/`** - Shared architectural and implementation documentation

## Quick Start

### Installation (Phase 1 - Development)

```bash
cd packages/mcp-server
pip install -e .
```

### Configuration

Add to your Claude Code MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "session-coordinator": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "claude_session_coordinator"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/project"
    }
  }
}
```

## Features

### Storage Adapters

- **Local File Adapter** (Phase 1) - Simple JSON file storage
- **Redis Adapter** (Phase 2+) - Cross-machine coordination
- **Custom Adapters** - Implement your own backend

### MCP Tools

- `sign_on()` - Claim an instance and establish session identity
- `store_data()` - Store data in scoped contexts
- `retrieve_data()` - Retrieve stored data
- `list_keys()` - Discover available keys in a scope
- `list_scopes()` - List all scopes with optional filtering
- `delete_data()` - Remove specific data
- `delete_scope()` - Remove entire scope
- `sign_off()` - Release session instance

### MCP Resources

- `session://context` - Current session state and available instances
- `session://state/{id}` - Read other sessions' state (coordination)

### MCP Prompts

- `startup` - Guides Claude through sign-on process
- `sign-off` - Guides proper session release
